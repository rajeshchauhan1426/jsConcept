// An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) in JavaScript is a function that is defined and executed immediately after it's created. It's a common JavaScript design pattern used to create a private scope for variables and functions, preventing them from polluting the global scope. This is particularly useful for avoiding naming conflicts and encapsulating code.

// Here's the basic syntax of an IIFE:

// ```javascript
// (function () {
//   // code here
// })();
// ```

// Let's break down the components:

// 1. `(function () { ... })`: This part defines an anonymous function enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses around the function declaration are necessary to prevent it from being treated as a function declaration statement, which would require a name.

// 2. `(...)` at the end: These parentheses immediately invoke (call) the function. This is what makes it an "immediately invoked" function expression. You can also pass arguments into these parentheses if your IIFE requires parameters.

// Here's an example of how you might use an IIFE:

// ```javascript
// (function () {
//   var privateVariable = 42;
  
//   function privateFunction() {
//     console.log("This is a private function.");
//   }

//   // This code is self-contained and won't pollute the global scope
//   // You can't access privateVariable or privateFunction outside this function scope
// })();

// // Attempting to access privateVariable or privateFunction here will result in an error
// ```

// IIFE is commonly used in JavaScript libraries and modules to encapsulate code and avoid exposing internal details to the global scope. It's less common in modern JavaScript development, as newer language features like block-scoped variables (`let` and `const`) and modules provide more elegant solutions for managing scope and avoiding global pollution.
