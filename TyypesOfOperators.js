// In JavaScript, operators are symbols or keywords that allow you to perform operations on values or variables. Operators in JavaScript can be categorized into several types based on the operations they perform. Here are the main types of operators in JavaScript:

// Arithmetic Operators: These operators perform basic arithmetic operations.

// + (Addition)
// - (Subtraction)
// * (Multiplication)
// / (Division)
// % (Modulus, remainder of division)
// ++ (Increment)
// -- (Decrement)
// Assignment Operators: These operators assign values to variables.

// = (Assignment)
// += (Add and assign)
// -= (Subtract and assign)
// *= (Multiply and assign)
// /= (Divide and assign)
// %= (Modulus and assign)
// Comparison Operators: These operators compare values and return a boolean.

// == (Equal to, loose equality)
// === (Equal to, strict equality)
// != (Not equal to, loose inequality)
// !== (Not equal to, strict inequality)
// > (Greater than)
// < (Less than)
// >= (Greater than or equal to)
// <= (Less than or equal to)
// Logical Operators: These operators perform logical operations on boolean values.

// && (Logical AND)
// || (Logical OR)
// ! (Logical NOT)
// Unary Operators: These operators work on a single operand.

// typeof (Returns a string indicating the data type)
// delete (Deletes a property from an object)
// + (Unary plus, converts its operand to a number)
// - (Unary minus, negates its operand)
// ! (Unary NOT)
// Ternary Operator: A conditional operator that returns a value based on a condition.

// condition ? expr1 : expr2
// Bitwise Operators: These operators work on individual bits of integers.

// & (Bitwise AND)
// | (Bitwise OR)
// ^ (Bitwise XOR)
// ~ (Bitwise NOT)
// << (Left shift)
// >> (Right shift)
// >>> (Unsigned right shift)
// // These operators are fundamental to JavaScript programming and are used to perform various operations on values, control the flow of your code, and manipulate data. Understanding how to use these operators is essential for effective JavaScript development.
