// In JavaScript, the try...catch...finally statement is used for handling exceptions (errors) and defining cleanup logic that should always run, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. This construct is particularly useful for ensuring that resources are properly released or specific actions are taken, such as closing files or cleaning up after an operation, even if an error occurs.

// The basic syntax of try...catch...finally is as follows:

// javascript
// Copy code
// try {
//   // Code that may throw an exception
// } catch (error) {
//   // Code to handle the exception
// } finally {
//   // Code that always runs, whether there was an exception or not
// }
// Here's an example illustrating how try...catch...finally works:

// javascript
// Copy code
// function divide(a, b) {
//   try {
//     if (b === 0) {
//       throw new Error("Division by zero is not allowed.");
//     }
//     return a / b;
//   } catch (error) {
//     console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
//     return "Error occurred";
//   } finally {
//     console.log("Division operation finished.");
//   }
// }

// const result1 = divide(10, 2); // No exception is thrown
// console.log("Result 1:", result1);

// const result2 = divide(10, 0); // An exception is thrown
// console.log("Result 2:", result2);
// In this example:

// The divide function attempts to divide a by b. Inside the try block, we have a conditional check to throw an exception if b is equal to zero.

// If an exception is thrown, the code inside the catch block is executed. In this case, it logs an error message and returns "Error occurred."

// The finally block contains code that always runs, whether an exception was thrown or not. In this case, it logs "Division operation finished."

// When we call the divide function twice:

// The first call (divide(10, 2)) doesn't throw an exception, so it prints the result and the "Division operation finished" message.
// The second call (divide(10, 0)) throws an exception, which is caught by the catch block. It logs an error message and returns "Error occurred." Finally, the "Division operation finished" message is still logged because the finally block runs in all cases.
// The finally block is optional, and you can use try...catch without it if you don't need to execute any specific cleanup code. However, it's a valuable tool for ensuring that certain operations, like resource cleanup, always occur, even if an exception is thrown.
