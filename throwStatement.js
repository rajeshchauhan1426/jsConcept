// In JavaScript, the throw statement is used to create and throw exceptions. Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program, and they can be caught and handled by an appropriate exception handler. Using throw allows you to explicitly signal that an exceptional condition has occurred and needs to be handled.

// The basic syntax of the throw statement is as follows:

// javascript
// Copy code
// throw expression;
// Here's an example of how you might use the throw statement to create and throw a custom exception:

// javascript
// Copy code
// function divide(a, b) {
//   if (b === 0) {
//     throw new Error("Division by zero is not allowed.");
//   }
//   return a / b;
// }

// try {
//   const result = divide(10, 0);
//   console.log("Result:", result);
// } catch (error) {
//   console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
// }
// In this example:

// We define a divide function that takes two parameters, a and b. If b is equal to zero, we use the throw statement to create and throw a new Error object with a custom error message.

// We then call the divide function with arguments 10 and 0. Since we're trying to divide by zero, an exception is thrown.

// We use a try...catch block to catch and handle the exception. If an exception is thrown within the try block, it is caught by the catch block, and we can access the error object and its properties. In this case, we print the error message to the console.

// The throw statement can be used to throw various types of objects, including custom error objects, strings, numbers, and more. However, it's a good practice to throw error objects, as they provide more information about the nature of the exception and can be customized to include additional details.

// By using the throw statement strategically in your code, you can handle exceptional conditions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.
