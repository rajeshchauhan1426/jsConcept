// Garbage collection in JavaScript is the automatic process by which the language's runtime environment manages memory and reclaims memory that is no longer in use or referenced by the program. JavaScript uses a technique called "garbage collection" to identify and clean up unused objects and memory. Here's how it works:

// 1. **Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm**:
//    - JavaScript typically uses the "Mark-and-Sweep" garbage collection algorithm, which consists of two main phases: marking and sweeping.
//    - **Marking**: The garbage collector starts from a set of root objects, which are usually global objects, local variables, or objects in the call stack, and traverses the entire object graph, marking every object it encounters as "reachable."
//    - **Sweeping**: After marking all reachable objects, the garbage collector sweeps through memory, deallocating (or "sweeping") memory that is not marked as reachable. This memory is considered garbage and is released, making it available for future allocations.

// 2. **Reference Counting (Not Used in JavaScript)**:
//    - Some programming languages use reference counting for garbage collection. In reference counting, each object keeps track of the number of references to it, and when the count reaches zero (i.e., the object is no longer referenced), it is considered garbage and is deallocated. However, JavaScript does not use reference counting due to its inability to handle circular references.

// 3. **Automatic Nature**:
//    - JavaScript's garbage collection is entirely automatic, meaning developers don't need to manually allocate or deallocate memory. The runtime environment handles memory management behind the scenes.

// 4. **Memory Leaks**:
//    - While JavaScript has automatic garbage collection, memory leaks can still occur if developers inadvertently retain references to objects that are no longer needed. Common causes of memory leaks include circular references, long-lived references, and improper use of closures.

// 5. **Memory Profiling Tools**:
//    - Modern web browsers and development tools provide memory profiling tools that help developers identify and diagnose memory issues in their JavaScript applications. These tools allow developers to visualize memory usage, identify memory leaks, and optimize memory management.

// 6. **Best Practices**:
//    - Developers can take steps to avoid memory leaks and optimize memory usage in their JavaScript code. These include properly managing references, releasing objects when they are no longer needed (e.g., setting variables to `null`), and removing event listeners and other resource-intensive operations when they are no longer necessary.

// In summary, garbage collection in JavaScript is an automatic process that manages memory by identifying and reclaiming unused memory through the Mark-and-Sweep algorithm. While JavaScript handles memory management automatically, developers should be aware of best practices to prevent memory leaks and ensure efficient memory usage in their applications.
