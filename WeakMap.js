// A WeakMap in JavaScript is a built-in data structure introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) that allows you to create a map of key-value pairs where the keys are weakly referenced. This means that if there are no other references to a key in the WeakMap, the key and its corresponding value can be garbage collected.




// Weak References:
// The key objects in a WeakMap are held by weak references, which means that if there are no other references to a key object, it can be automatically garbage collected. This is different from regular Map where keys are held by strong references.
