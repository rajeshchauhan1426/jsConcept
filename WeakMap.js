// A WeakMap in JavaScript is a built-in data structure introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) that allows you to create a map of key-value pairs where the keys are weakly referenced. This means that if there are no other references to a key in the WeakMap, the key and its corresponding value can be garbage collected.




// Weak References:
// The key objects in a WeakMap are held by weak references, which means that if there are no other references to a key object, it can be automatically garbage collected. This is different from regular Map where keys are held by strong references.






//Use Cases:
// WeakMap is often used in scenarios where you want to associate data with an object without preventing that object from being garbage collected when it's no longer needed. This is particularly useful for managing metadata or additional information related to objects in a memory-efficient way.

// It's important to note that WeakMap has some limitations. For example, you cannot iterate over its keys or values directly, and it does not have a size property to determine its length. Additionally, WeakMap keys must be objects; primitive values like strings or numbers cannot be used as keys.
