// In JavaScript, the for...of statement is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object, such as an array, string, or other iterable data structures. It provides a more concise and straightforward way to loop through the elements of a collection compared to the for...in loop, which is more suitable for iterating over object properties. Here's the basic syntax of the for...of loop:

// javascript
// Copy code
// for (variable of iterable) {
//     // code to be executed for each element in the iterable
// }
// variable: This is a variable that represents the current element value during each iteration.
// iterable: An object that has iterable properties, such as an array or a string.
// Here are a couple of examples demonstrating how to use the for...of loop:

// Iterating over an array:
// javascript
// Copy code
// const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

// for (const color of colors) {
//     console.log(color);
// }
// Iterating over the characters in a string:
// javascript
// Copy code
// const message = "Hello, World!";

// for (const char of message) {
//     console.log(char);
// }
// The for...of loop is particularly useful when you want to work with the values themselves without worrying about indices or keys. It works well with any iterable data structure and provides a clean and readable way to loop through its elements.
