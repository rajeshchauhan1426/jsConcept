// Memory management in JavaScript is handled automatically by the language itself through a mechanism called garbage collection. Here are some key points to understand about memory management in JavaScript:

// 1. **Garbage Collection**: JavaScript uses a garbage collector to automatically allocate and deallocate memory. The garbage collector identifies objects in memory that are no longer reachable or referenced by the program and frees up the memory they occupy.

// 2. **Reference Counting**: One of the simplest garbage collection techniques is reference counting. In this method, every object keeps a count of the number of references to it. When the reference count reaches zero (i.e., the object is no longer referenced), it is considered garbage and can be safely deallocated. However, JavaScript does not use reference counting for garbage collection because it cannot handle circular references.

// 3. **Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm**: JavaScript engines typically use a more advanced technique called the "Mark-and-Sweep" algorithm. Here's how it works:
//    - **Mark**: The garbage collector starts from a set of root objects (usually global variables, local variables, or objects in the call stack) and traverses the entire object graph, marking every object it encounters as "reachable."
//    - **Sweep**: After marking all reachable objects, the garbage collector sweeps through memory, deallocating (or reclaiming) memory that is not marked as reachable. This memory is considered garbage.

// 4. **Memory Leaks**: Even though JavaScript has automatic memory management, memory leaks can still occur. A memory leak happens when objects that are no longer needed are still referenced, preventing them from being collected. Common causes of memory leaks in JavaScript include circular references, long-lived references, and improper use of closures.

// 5. **Managing Memory Manually**: While JavaScript handles memory management automatically, developers can still take steps to optimize memory usage:
//    - Release references to objects when they are no longer needed. Set variables or object properties to `null` or `undefined` to allow the garbage collector to free up memory.
//    - Use closures and local scopes effectively to control the lifespan of objects and variables.
//    - Be mindful of event listeners and remove them when they are no longer needed to avoid retaining references.

// 6. **Memory Profiling**: Modern web browsers and development tools provide memory profiling tools that allow developers to analyze memory usage in their JavaScript applications. These tools can help identify memory leaks and optimize memory usage.

// In summary, JavaScript's memory management is automatic and relies on a garbage collector that uses the Mark-and-Sweep algorithm to reclaim memory. While developers don't need to manually allocate or deallocate memory, they should still be aware of best practices for managing references and preventing memory leaks to ensure efficient memory usage in their applications.
