// In JavaScript, the memory lifecycle of objects follows a pattern that can be understood through several stages: allocation, usage, and deallocation. Here's a breakdown of each stage:

// 1. **Allocation**:
//    - **Object Creation**: Memory is allocated when you create objects or variables in JavaScript. For example, when you declare a variable or create an object using `let`, `const`, or `new`, memory is allocated to store that object's data and properties.

//    ```javascript
//    let x = 42; // Memory allocated for the variable 'x'
//    const obj = {}; // Memory allocated for an empty object
//    ```

// 2. **Usage**:
//    - **Initialization**: After allocation, you can initialize objects or variables with data. Memory is used to store the data you assign to them.

//    ```javascript
//    let name = "John"; // Memory used to store the string "John"
//    const person = { firstName: "Jane", age: 30 }; // Memory used for object properties and their values
//    ```

//    - **Operations**: As your program executes, memory is used for various operations, including function calls, calculations, and manipulating objects and variables.

//    ```javascript
//    function add(a, b) {
//      return a + b; // Memory used for function execution
//    }
   
//    let result = add(5, 7); // Memory used for storing the result (12)
//    ```

// 3. **Deallocation (Garbage Collection)**:
//    - JavaScript automatically manages memory deallocation through a process called garbage collection. When objects or variables are no longer reachable, they become eligible for garbage collection. This typically happens when there are no references pointing to them.
   
//    ```javascript
//    let obj1 = { data: 42 };
//    let obj2 = obj1; // Both obj1 and obj2 reference the same object

//    obj1 = null; // obj1 no longer references the object
//    // Memory allocated to the object { data: 42 } is still in use because obj2 references it.

//    obj2 = null; // Now, no references to the object remain, so it becomes eligible for garbage collection.
//    ```

//    - Circular references and memory leaks can prevent objects from being deallocated, as they still have references to them, even if those references are not reachable from the global scope.

// 4. **Finalization (optional)**:
//    - JavaScript doesn't have a built-in finalization step. Unlike some languages, you don't explicitly release memory or run cleanup code when an object is deallocated. Instead, JavaScript relies on the garbage collector to automatically handle memory cleanup.

// 5. **Implicit Deallocation (optional)**:
//    - Some JavaScript objects may have their own mechanisms for deallocation or cleanup. For example, event listeners can be removed using methods like `removeEventListener` to release resources associated with DOM elements.

// It's important to note that developers typically don't need to worry about manual memory management in JavaScript, thanks to automatic garbage collection. However, they should be mindful of best practices to avoid memory leaks, such as properly managing references, cleaning up resources when necessary (e.g., closing files, removing event listeners), and using memory profiling tools to identify and address performance issues related to memory usage.
