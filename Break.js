// In JavaScript, the break statement is used to exit or "break out" of a loop prematurely, before the loop condition has been fully satisfied. It is typically used in for, while, and do...while loops to terminate the loop when a certain condition is met. Here's how the break statement works:

// javascript
// Copy code
// for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
//     // code to be executed
//     if (someCondition) {
//         break; // exit the loop prematurely
//     }
// }
// Here's an example using a for loop:

// javascript
// Copy code
// for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
//     if (i === 3) {
//         break; // exit the loop when i equals 3
//     }
//     console.log(i);
// }
// In this example, the loop will print the values of i from 0 to 2 and then exit when i becomes 3 due to the break statement.

// You can also use the break statement in while and do...while loops in a similar way. It's commonly used to stop looping when a specific condition is met or when you need to exit a loop prematurely based on some criteria.
