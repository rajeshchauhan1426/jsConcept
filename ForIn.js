// In JavaScript, the for...in statement is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object. It is often used with objects, as it iterates over the keys (property names) of an object. Here's the basic syntax:

// javascript
// Copy code
// for (variable in object) {
//     // code to be executed for each property of the object
// }
// variable: This is a variable that represents the current property name during each iteration.
// object: The object over whose properties you want to iterate.
// Here's an example of how you can use for...in to loop through the properties of an object:

// javascript
// Copy code
// const person = {
//     firstName: "John",
//     lastName: "Doe",
//     age: 30
// };

// for (let key in person) {
//     console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
// }
// In this example, the for...in loop iterates over the properties of the person object, and key represents the property name (e.g., "firstName", "lastName", "age"). Inside the loop, you can access the property value using object[key].

// However, it's important to note that for...in should generally be used with objects and not arrays, as it can also iterate over inherited properties and may not guarantee a specific order for object properties. If you need to iterate over the elements of an array, it's usually better to use a for...of loop or other array-specific methods like forEach().
