// Conditional operators in JavaScript, often referred to as ternary operators, are used to perform a conditional operation that results in one of two values based on a condition. The basic syntax of the conditional operator is:

// javascript
// Copy code
// condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;
// Here's a breakdown of how it works:

// condition: This is an expression that is evaluated to either true or false.

// expression_if_true: If the condition is true, the value of expression_if_true is returned.

// expression_if_false: If the condition is false, the value of expression_if_false is returned.

// The conditional operator is often used as a concise alternative to an if-else statement when you want to assign a value based on a condition. Here are some examples:

// javascript
// Copy code
// // Example 1: Assign a value based on a condition
// const age = 25;
// const isAdult = age >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No"; // "Yes"

// // Example 2: Display a message based on a condition
// const isLoggedIn = true;
// const message = isLoggedIn ? "Welcome back!" : "Please log in."; // "Welcome back!"

// // Example 3: Calculate the maximum of two numbers
// const num1 = 42;
// const num2 = 67;
// const max = num1 > num2 ? num1 : num2; // 67

// // Example 4: Use conditional operator within a template literal
// const isSunny = true;
// const weatherMessage = `The weather is ${isSunny ? "sunny" : "cloudy"} today.`; // "The weather is sunny today."
// In these examples, the conditional operator ? : allows you to make decisions and assign values or create expressions based on conditions in a concise manner. It's a powerful tool for writing compact and readable code when you have simple conditional logic.
